jCS4 - jQuery CSS Slide Show
==================================================

A small plugin to fast create a Slide Show, using native browser resources and requesting less data as possible. I written this plugin because I didn't found any other good one that was not too big for my projects.

Read more and see it in action visiting [jCS4](http://hub.edirpedr.com/jCS4/).


Objectives
--------------------------------------------------

- Use only CSS Animations to get hardware acceleration;
- Write only functions that is really usefull to many situations;
- Stay small and fast as possible.


Todo
--------------------------------------------------

- Include a loader to wait for images;
- Write some ideas to serve for fast development;
- Increse documentation;
- Create an option to animate In and Out slide effect, could be `data-effectIn` and `data-effectOut`, the rest of the options would be the same. But I'm not sure if this is really necessary!
